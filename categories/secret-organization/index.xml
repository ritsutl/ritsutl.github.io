      <description>Who&amp;rsquo;s the traitor? - Part 1 It was time for the betrayal event featuring Baba. It would start with the disappearance of some PSI drives.
Tricked by the wicked Demon King who was allegedly manipulating the World&amp;rsquo;s Darkness, Baba would hand over a couple of PSI Drives and their blueprints (she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t actually hand it over), and leak Amaterasu&amp;rsquo;s classified information (no, she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t leak anything either).
The students would fortuitously notice some PSI drive were missing and report it to Kaburagi-san.</description>
